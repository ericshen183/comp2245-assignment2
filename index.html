        <h2>My Favorite Books</h2>
        <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-10-11">October 11, 2024</time> by <a href="#">Eric Shen</a></p>
        <p>I love reading books. In fact the majority of my childhood and adult life was shaped by the books I had read.
            The fantastical imagery from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, the philosophical musings of Friedrich Nietzsche, and even the colorful
            imagery of the Harry Potter series. I have read many books and they have never failed to light the fire of imagination within myself.
        </p>
        <p>As I keep reading, I’ve come to realize that books are not just stories—they’re companions that walk beside us through life’s journey. Each new book brings with it a fresh perspective, opening my mind and urging me to think more deeply about the world I live in. Whether I’m reading to escape reality, to gain knowledge, or simply to be inspired, the impact that literature has is truly unmatched. Through these experiences, I’ve come to see the real magic of books: their power to connect, transform, and ignite something within us.</p>
